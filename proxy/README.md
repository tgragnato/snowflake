This is a standalone (not browser-based) version of the Snowflake proxy. For browser-based versions of the Snowflake proxy, see https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/snowflake-webext.

### Dependencies

- Go 1.15+
- We use the [pion/webrtc](https://github.com/pion/webrtc) library for WebRTC communication with Snowflake proxies. Note: running `go get` will fetch this dependency automatically during the build process.

### Building the standalone Snowflake proxy

To build the Snowflake proxy, make sure you are in the `proxy/` directory, and then run:

```
go get
go build
```
